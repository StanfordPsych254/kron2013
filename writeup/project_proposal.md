###**Motivation:**  

I'm currently doing a research project involving repeated, brief twice-daily measures of current affect. I plan to use Kron and colleagues' unipolar scales assessing valence and arousal to quantify affect, but would like to do a replication of their study to determine whether their method indeed capture more information compared to the more widely used bipolar affect scales.

###**Stimuli & Procedure:** 

The authors showed 72 IAPS (Lang et al., 1997) pictures that equally represented arousal and valence space, with no correlation between arousal and valence (*r* = -0.08, with a marginal quadratic component, *R^2* = 0.06). To choose these pictures, they created an 8 by 8 valence by arousal stimulus selection grid. Forty of the 64 cells included more than one entry, so, if there were multiples, the authors selected the image in the left-most corner. **(This is not completely clear to me...)**
The authors also included each of eight combinations of the most extreme values of low and high positive valence, negative valence, and arousal. They included 4 IAPS photos randomly selected from each of those 8 extreme value combinations.
**I am not sure how 64 + 32 pictures adds up to 72 final stimuli. Perhas the authors used the 40 that had been multiples?**

Each trial of image presentation started with a blank screen randomly jittered to be presented from 10-21 sec. The IAPS picture was then presented for 6 sec, followed by a presentation of the rating scale.
Each participants rated 36 pictures using the unipolar pleasant and unpleasant rating scales and 36 pictures pictures using bipolar valence and arousal scales. The order of scales was counterbalanced between participants and the order of blocks and trials was counterbalanced between participants.

The unipolar affect rating scales were two separate scales, one ranging from no pleasant feelings (0) to strong pleasant feelings (8) and the other from no unpleasant feelings (0) to strong unpleasant feelings (8).

The bipolar affect rating scale ranged from unpleasant feelings (-4) to pleasant feelings (4) for valence and calm (0) to aroused (8) for arousal.


###**Challenges:**
I will be replicating only Experiment 1 of the study (not Experiment 2), and will only replicate the behavioral task, not the psychophysiological measures.

It may be somewhat challenging to ensure that I'm using appropriately similar stimuli, given the lack of clarity in some of Kron's instructions for stimulus selection. I'll be emailing to ask if they can share their exactly stimulus set (which # IAPS pictures they used).

Otherwise, the procedure should be fairly straightforward to implement in Mechanical Turk, working off of javascript programs created by other past students in this class.
